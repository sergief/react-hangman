# React Hangman

This project is an implementation of the classic game [Hangman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)) built using React and Redux.
It's just a proof of concept to learn how to use Redux and React for creating dynamic components.

It also uses [Semantic-UI](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) as a UI component library.

The supported language is `english`, thanks to the dictionary published by [adambom](https://github.com/adambom/dictionary)
